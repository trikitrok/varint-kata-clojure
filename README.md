# varint kata by [Eric Le Merdy](http://eric.lemerdy.name/)

## How to run the tests ##

The project uses [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje/).

`lein midje` will run all tests.

`lein midje namespace.*` will run only tests beginning with "namespace.".

`lein midje :autotest` will run all the tests indefinitely. It sets up a
watcher on the code files. If they change, only the relevant tests will be
run again.

## Problem description ##

Your mission is to convert any int in its varint binary representation.

    int -> varint

As an extra exercice, do the opposite: try to convert varints binary representation to int. What is the amount of duplicated code?

### Base 128 Varints ###

To understand your simple protocol buffer encoding, you first need to understand varints. Varints are a method of serializing integers using one or more bytes. Smaller numbers take a smaller number of bytes.

Each byte in a varint, except the last byte, has the most significant bit (*msb*) set – this indicates that there are further bytes to come. The lower 7 bits of each byte are used to store the two's complement representation of the number in groups of 7 bits, least significant group first.

So, for example, here is the number **1** – it's a single byte, so the msb is not set:

    0000 0001

And here is **300** – this is a bit more complicated:

       1010 1100 0000 0010

How do you figure out that this is 300? First you drop the msb from each byte, as this is just there to tell us whether we've reached the end of the number (as you can see, it's set in the first byte as there is more than one byte in the varint):

       1010 1100 0000 0010
    ->  010 1100  000 0010

You reverse the two groups of 7 bits because, as you remember, varints store numbers with the least significant group first.

        010 1100  000 0010
    ->  000 0010  010 1100

Then you concatenate them to get your final value:

	    000 0010 ++ 010 1100
	->  100101100
	->  256 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 300
